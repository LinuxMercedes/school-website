<h2>CS 5201: Submitting with Git</h2>

<p>You have the option of using Git to submit your homeworks this semester.
Some advantages of using Git include:
<ul>
	<li>You get practice using a popular version control system</li>
	<li>You can submit from any machine with a git client</li>
	<li>You can verify that you submitted correctly</li>
	<li>I will make line comments on good code and subtle gotchas or bugs I see (as time permits)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you wish to use Git to submit your homework, please log into <a href="https://git-classes.mst.edu/">GitLab</a>, then
email me with your SSO ID so I can add you to the Git submitters list. If you change your mind later, email me and I can switch
you back to using cssubmit.</p>

<h3>How To Submit</h3>
<p>
I will make you a repository on <a href="https://git-classes.mst.edu/">GitLab</a> for each homework assignment.
You will get an email about this when the homework is assigned.

<ol>
	<li>Go to <a href="https://git-classes.mst.edu/">GitLab</a> and clone the repository for that homework assignment</li>
	<li>Do your homework, committing it as you go</li>
	<li>When you are finished, push your commits to the repository</li>
	<li>Check the repository on GitLab to be sure your submission is correct</li>
</ol>

Please do not commit any compiled stuff (object files, executables) or other junk (core dumps, memes, etc.) to your repositories.
</p>

<h3>Setting up Git</h3>
<p>
Here are some resources for getting started with git:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cpl.mwisely.xyz/submitting/">Michael Wisely's page on setting up and using git</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://git.mst.edu/help/gitlab-basics/README.md">Guides for using GitLab</a></li>
</ul>

As always, feel free to ask me if you have any <a href="http://www.desktopdress.com/desktopwallpapers/animals/hairy-horse.jpg">difficult questions</a>.

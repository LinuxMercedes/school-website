<h2>CS 5201: Using Doxygen</h2>

<p>This semester, every programming assignment in this class (read: every assignment except the first) must be documented using
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>.
Doxygen is a tool that takes properly-formatted comments and produces documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML and LaTeX.
This documentation is pleasing to the eye, makes working with large libraries less painful, clears up various skin blemishes, and adds years to your life!
Furthermore, it provides a bit of structure to commenting, which will help you develop a sense for what you ought to be including in your comments.
<a href="doxygen/docs/html/classVector.html">This example</a> shows what the HTML documentation looks like.
</p>


<h3>Homework Requirements</h3>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Your submission <b>must</b> include a Doxygen configuration file named <code>Doxyfile</code>.</li>
	<li>Every class and member function <b>must</b> be documented.</li>
</ol>
For advice on writing documentation, see the page on <a href="commenting.html">pre- and post-conditions</a>.
</p>

<h3>Using Doxygen</h3>

<p>Doxygen requires a configuration file in order to know how you want your documentation to be generated.
Run <code>doxygen -g</code> in your homework directory to generate a default configuration.
You should edit this at least a little bit; here's what I changed:
<ul>
	<li><code>PROJECT_NAME</code> Put a lil' pizzazz in your documentation for heaven's sake!</li>
	<li><code>OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code> Set this to <code>docs</code> so Doxygen doesn't clutter things up with generated files.</li>
	<li><code>QUIET</code> Set this to <code>YES</code> so Doxygen doesn't get too chatty.</li>
	<li><code>*_AUTOBRIEF</code> This is personal taste, but
		<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/config.html#cfg_javadoc_autobrief">autobrief</a>
		is pretty nice.
	</li>
</ul>

Also, <b>do not touch</b> the <code>WARNINGS</code> setting! Instead, write docs so that you don't get any warnings in the first place.
</p>

<p>Once you've generated a configuration, you'll want to write comments in your source code that Doxygen understands.
For the most part, they'll be exactly how you'd write them normally, but with two caveats:
<ol>
	<li>You'll need to use a <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html">comment block</a> that Doxygen knows
		to look for documentation in.
	</li>
	<li>You'll need to include <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html">commands</a> indicating things like
		preconditions, postconditions, parameters, return values, and thrown exceptions.
	</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Finally, you need to actually generate your documentation. Run <code>doxygen Doxyfile</code> to do so.</p>

<p>See <a href="doxygen">the example code</a> for a good starting point, including a reasonable config file.
If you have further questions, see <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html">the Doxygen manual</a>
or ask <a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/the_graduate.jpg">your loving TA</a>.
(If you don't have a loving TA, you can ask me instead.)

<title>CS 153 Homework Scraper</title>

<a href="..">Home</a>  <a href="../misc.html">Misc</a>
<p>Parser for Matt Buechler's CS153 webpages. Just give it the URL for the homework webpage that you want to convert. It parses the webpage, creates a code file for each code file Buechler wants and puts in skeletal comments to make documenting easier. Edit the config variables to make life even easier for you.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any problems and/or have fixed a bug and/or have added a feature. My apologies for my terrible documentation; that will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>Does not match some functions:</li>
<ul>
<li>unsigned int max_size () const;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Credits:
<ul>
<li>Doug Kelly: awesome perl-fu to fix my really bad problems</li>
<li>Me: I pretty much pounded on a keyboard, and this came out. It's pretty cool, eh?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Perceiving Yourself as Smart</h2>
People say that I'm smart
I don't like to perceive myself as that
Perception based on what I do
smart -> succeed -> feel good
smart -> fail -> blame everything else
dumb -> succeed -> "eh, wasn't that hard"
dumb -> fail -> "what did you expect"
"what you do" -> succeed -> "keep going"
"what you do" -> fail -> "try harder"
